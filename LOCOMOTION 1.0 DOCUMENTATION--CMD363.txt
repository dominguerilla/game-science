LOCOMOTION 1.0 DOCUMENTATION--CMD363
====================================

There are two prefabs, MocapAvatar and Skeleton that are ready to use out of the box.
WASD to run/walk
CapsLock to toggle run/walk
Space to Jump

In order to utilize your own model:
First, note that the script controlling movement is PlayerMove.cs.
1. Spawn your Mecanim-friendly model, along with its avatar. 
2. If somehow your model does not have an Animator component, add it as a component.
3. Drag the Animator Controller 'PlayerMove' to the Controller slot in the Animator component in the Inspector.
4. Uncheck the box under the Animator Component section in the Inspector that says 'Apply Root Motion'.
5. Create an empty GameObject, and make your model the child of this empty object.
6. Add the script PlayerMove.cs TO THE EMPTY PARENT GAMEOBJECT. It should automatically add a CharacterController component to it. If not, add a CharacterController component to the parent Gameobject.
7. Finally, ensure that the X-Y orientation of the parent CharacterController and the child model are the same. If not, rotate one or the other so that they match.

You may have to adjust the Y-displacement of the model so that the model's feet properly touches the floor.
